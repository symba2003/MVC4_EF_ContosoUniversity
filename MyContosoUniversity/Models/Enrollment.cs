   There's a many-to-many relationship between the Student and Course entities, and the Enrollment entity functions as a many-to-many join table 
     * with payload in the database. This means that the Enrollment table contains additional data besides foreign keys for the joined tables 
     * (in this case, a primary key and a Grade property).
     * 
     * If the Enrollment table didn't include grade information, it would only need to contain the two foreign keys CourseID and PersonID. 
     * In that case, it would correspond to a many-to-many join table without payload (or a pure join table) in the database, and you wouldn't
     * have to create a model class for it at all. The Instructor and Course entities have that kind of many-to-many relationship, and as you can
     * see, there is no entity class between them. A join table is required in the database, however. The Entity Framework automatically creates
     * the CourseInstructor table, and you read and update it indirectly by reading and updating the Instructor.Courses and Course.Instructors 
     * navigation properties.
