         When there is a  one-to-zero-or-one relationship or a  one-to-one relationship between two entities (such as between OfficeAssignment and Instructor), EF can't work out which end of the relationship is the principal and which end is dependent.  One-to-one relationships have a reference navigation property in each class to the other class. The ForeignKey Attribute can be applied to the dependent class to establish the relationship
