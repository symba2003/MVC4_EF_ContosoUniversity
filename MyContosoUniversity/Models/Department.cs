        /*
         Note By convention, the Entity Framework enables cascade delete for non-nullable foreign keys and for many-to-many relationships. 
         * This can result in circular cascade delete rules, which will cause an exception when your initializer code runs. For example,
         * if you didn't define the Department.InstructorID property as nullable, you'd get the following exception message when the initializer
         * runs: "The referential relationship will result in a cyclical reference that's not allowed." If your business rules required InstructorID
         * property as non-nullable, you would have to use the following fluent API to disable cascade delete on the relationship:
         * 
         * modelBuilder.Entity().HasRequired(d => d.Administrator).WithMany().WillCascadeOnDelete(false);
